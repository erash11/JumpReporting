1. Go to https://nodejs.org

3. Install it
4. Restart Terminal/Command Prompt
5. Try again: `npm install`

### "Permission denied" or "EACCES error"
**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
sudo npm install
```
Enter your password when prompted.

### Build fails with errors
```bash
# Clear everything and start fresh
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm install
npm run build
```

### Can't find dist folder
**Make sure you:**
1. Ran `npm install` first
2. Ran `npm run build` second
3. Look in the project folder for a `dist/` directory

### Netlify upload fails
**Try:**
- Use a different browser (Chrome recommended)
- Zip the `dist` folder first, then upload the zip
