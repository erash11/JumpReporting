## PRIMARY PERFORMANCE METRICS

### Jump Height (cm)
**What it measures:** Maximum vertical displacement achieved during the jump  
**Calculation method:** Impulse-Momentum equation  
**Unit:** Centimeters (cm)  
**Typical values:**
- Elite skill players: 60-75 cm
- Good skill players: 50-60 cm
- Linemen: 30-45 cm

**Interpretation:**
- Primary indicator of explosive lower-body power
- Highly correlated with sprint speed and change of direction
- Position-dependent - normalize by position for comparisons

**Training applications:**
- Monitor training effectiveness
- Detect fatigue (>10% decline may indicate overtraining)
- Track return to play progression

---

### Peak Power (W)
**What it measures:** Maximum power output during the concentric (upward) phase  
**Calculation:** Peak Force × Peak Velocity  
**Unit:** Watts (W)  
**Typical values:**
- Heavy athletes (TE, OL, DL): 6,000-8,500 W
- Mid-weight athletes (LB, QB): 5,000-7,000 W
- Lighter athletes (WR, DB): 4,000-6,000 W

**Interpretation:**
- Best overall indicator of explosive strength
- Strongly influenced by body mass
- Related to acceleration and contact sports performance

**Training applications:**
- Track strength training effectiveness
- Correlate with Olympic lift performance
- Monitor power-to-weight ratio trends

---

### Peak Force (N)
**What it measures:** Maximum ground reaction force during concentric phase  
**Unit:** Newtons (N)  
**Typical values:**
- Heavy athletes: 3,500-4,500 N
- Mid-weight athletes: 2,500-3,500 N
- Lighter athletes: 2,000-2,800 N

**Interpretation:**
- Reflects maximum strength capacity
- Highly correlated with body mass (heavier = higher force)
- Use force/body weight ratio for comparisons across weight classes

**Calculation example:**  
Force-to-BW ratio = Peak Force (N) ÷ (Body Weight (kg) × 9.81)
- Good: >2.5
- Excellent: >3.0

---

### RSI-modified (Reactive Strength Index)
**What it measures:** Ratio of jump height to time to take off  
**Calculation:** Jump Height (m) ÷ Contraction Time (s)  
**Unit:** m/s (dimensionless ratio)  
**Typical values:**
- Excellent: >0.80
- Good: 0.60-0.80
- Average: 0.40-0.60
- Below average: <0.40

**Interpretation:**
- Measures reactive strength and neuromuscular efficiency
- Independent of body mass (unlike power and force)
- Sensitive to fatigue - excellent for monitoring
- Better indicator of elastic strength than jump height alone

**Key advantage:**
Unlike traditional RSI (used in drop jumps), RSI-modified doesn't require flight time, making it ideal for CMJ testing.

**Training applications:**
- Daily readiness monitoring
- Detect accumulated fatigue
- Track plyometric training adaptations

---

## TEMPORAL METRICS

### Contraction Time (ms)
**What it measures:** Total time from initiation of movement to takeoff  
**Unit:** Milliseconds (ms)  
**Typical values:** 500-900 ms

**Interpretation:**
- Shorter = more explosive/reactive
- Longer = more strength-dominant strategy
- Position-dependent (linemen typically longer)

---

### Eccentric Duration (ms)
**What it measures:** Time spent in the downward (countermovement) phase  
**Unit:** Milliseconds (ms)  
**Typical values:** 350-600 ms

**Interpretation:**
- Optimal range depends on athlete and position
- Too short = insufficient pre-stretch
- Too long = energy dissipation

---

## KINEMATIC METRICS

### Vertical Velocity at Takeoff (m/s)
**What it measures:** Upward velocity when feet leave the ground  
**Unit:** Meters per second (m/s)  
**Typical values:** 2.4-3.8 m/s

**Interpretation:**
- Directly determines jump height (h = v²/2g)
- Pure indicator of explosive capability
- Related to acceleration and sprint performance

**Physics note:**  
Jump height (cm) ≈ (Takeoff Velocity)² × 5.1

---

### Countermovement Depth (cm)
**What it measures:** Maximum downward displacement during eccentric phase  
**Unit:** Centimeters (cm)  
**Typical values:** 
- Optimal: 30-45 cm
- Excessive: >50 cm

**Interpretation:**
- Reflects eccentric control and strategy
- Deeper not always better - efficiency matters
- Very deep may indicate poor eccentric strength

---

## FORCE-TIME CHARACTERISTICS

### Concentric Impulse (N·s)
**What it measures:** Force × Time integral during upward phase  
**Unit:** Newton-seconds (N·s)  
**Typical values:** 250-400 N·s

**Interpretation:**
- Represents total upward momentum created
- Directly related to takeoff velocity
- Combined measure of force and time

**Relationship:**  
Impulse = Change in Momentum = Mass × Takeoff Velocity

---

### Eccentric Braking Impulse (N·s)
**What it measures:** Force × Time integral during deceleration phase  
**Unit:** Newton-seconds (N·s)

**Interpretation:**
- Reflects eccentric strength and control
- Important for injury prevention
- Correlates with deceleration ability

---

## ASYMMETRY METRICS

### Concentric Impulse Asymmetry (%)
**What it measures:** Left-right imbalance in upward force production  
**Format:** "X.X% L" or "X.X% R" (indicating which side dominates)  
**Interpretation:**
- <5%: Normal, acceptable
- 5-10%: Monitor, may need attention  
- >10%: Concerning, warrants assessment
- >15%: High injury risk, requires intervention

**Clinical significance:**
- Post-injury: Track return to symmetry
- Injury prevention: Identify at-risk athletes
- Training focus: Guide unilateral exercise prescription

---

### Eccentric Braking Impulse Asymmetry (%)
**What it measures:** Left-right imbalance during deceleration  
**Interpretation:** Same thresholds as concentric asymmetry

**Why it matters:**
- Often more sensitive than concentric asymmetry
- Better predictor of landing/deceleration mechanics
- Important for cutting and change of direction sports

---

## BODY COMPOSITION

### Body Weight (kg)
**What it measures:** Athlete mass during testing  
**Unit:** Kilograms (kg)  
**Dashboard also shows:** Pounds (lbs)

**Applications:**
- Calculate relative metrics (force/BW, power/BW)
- Track weight changes over season
- Context for absolute performance values
- Identify appropriate comparison groups

---

## DERIVED METRICS & RATIOS

## CORRELATION MATRIX

**Strong Correlations (r > 0.80):**
- Jump Height ↔ Takeoff Velocity (r ≈ 0.98)
- Jump Height ↔ Peak Power (r ≈ 0.85-0.90)
- Peak Force ↔ Body Weight (r ≈ 0.85)

**Moderate Correlations (r = 0.50-0.80):**
- Jump Height ↔ RSI-modified (r ≈ 0.60)
- Peak Power ↔ Peak Force (r ≈ 0.75)

**Weak/Independent:**
- RSI-modified ↔ Body Weight (r ≈ 0.20)
- Asymmetry ↔ Performance metrics (r < 0.30)

**Practical application:**  
RSI and Asymmetry provide unique information not captured by jump height alone.

## MEASUREMENT CONSIDERATIONS

### Test Reliability
- Jump Height: CV = 3-5% (excellent)
- Peak Power: CV = 5-8% (good)
- RSI-modified: CV = 5-10% (good)
- Asymmetry: CV = 10-15% (moderate)

**What this means:**  
Day-to-day changes should exceed these values to be considered "real" changes vs. measurement error.

### Testing Protocol
- Warm-up: 5-10 minutes dynamic movement
- Trials: 2-3 maximal effort jumps
- Rest: 30-60 seconds between jumps
- Selection: Best jump or average (be consistent)

### Confounding Factors
- Time of day (morning typically 5-10% lower)
- Hydration status
- Recent training (test in recovered state for baselines)
- Surface stiffness (force plates are rigid)
