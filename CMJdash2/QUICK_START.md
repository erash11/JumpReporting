## üéØ Common Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Monitor Weekly Progress
**Goal:** Track if training is improving jump performance

**Steps:**
1. Select athlete in main dashboard
2. View progression charts
3. Look for upward trend in jump height
4. Check if RSI is stable or improving

**What to look for:**
- ‚úÖ Gradual increase in jump height (5-10% over weeks)
- ‚úÖ Stable or increasing RSI
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Declining RSI = potential fatigue

---

### Scenario 2: Identify At-Risk Athletes
**Goal:** Find athletes who may be overtraining or injured

**Steps:**
1. Open cohort analysis
2. Select position group
3. Sort by "Latest RSI" (lowest first)
4. Look for athletes with low RSI and/or asymmetry issues

**Warning signs:**
- üî¥ RSI drop >10% from baseline
- üî¥ Jump height decline with no injury
- üî¥ High asymmetry (>10%)

---

### Scenario 3: Position Group Benchmarking
**Goal:** Set position-specific standards

**Steps:**
1. Open cohort analysis
2. Select position (e.g., WR)
3. Note the position averages at top
4. Use these as benchmarks for incoming players

**Position Averages (Examples):**
- **WR:** ~50-55 cm jump, 5,000-6,000 W power
- **S:** ~55-60 cm jump, 5,500-6,500 W power  
- **OL:** ~35-40 cm jump, 7,000-8,000 W power

---

### Scenario 4: Return to Play Assessment
**Goal:** Determine if injured athlete is ready to return

**Steps:**
1. Find athlete's pre-injury baseline tests
2. Compare to current test
3. Check three criteria:
   - Jump height >90% of baseline
   - RSI >90% of baseline
   - Asymmetry <10%

**Example:**
Pre-injury: 60 cm jump, 0.85 RSI, 5% asymmetry  
Current: 56 cm jump, 0.78 RSI, 8% asymmetry  
**Decision:** Not ready - all metrics need improvement

## üìã Performance Rating System

The dashboard automatically assigns ratings:

| Rating | Meaning | % vs Position Avg |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| üü¢ **Excellent** | Elite performer | >15% above |
| üîµ **Good** | Above average | 5-15% above |
| ‚ö™ **Average** | At position norm | ¬±5% |
| üü° **Monitor** | Needs attention | 5-15% below |
| üî¥ **Needs Work** | Requires intervention | >15% below |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Metrics to Monitor

### Daily/Weekly Monitoring:
1. **RSI-modified** - Most sensitive to fatigue
2. **Jump Height** - Overall performance indicator

### Monthly Assessment:
1. **Peak Power** - Strength training effectiveness
2. **Asymmetry** - Injury risk screening

### Quarterly Review:
1. **Full metric battery** - Comprehensive profiling
2. **Position comparisons** - Benchmarking

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Test Consistently
‚úÖ Same time of day  
‚úÖ Same warm-up protocol  
‚úÖ Record in same condition (not after practice)

### Tip 2: Look for Patterns, Not Single Tests
- One bad test ‚â† problem
- Consistent decline over 2-3 tests = investigate
- Compare to athlete's own baseline, not just position average

### Tip 3: Context Matters
Ask these questions:
- Recent practice intensity?
- Body weight change?
- Sleep quality?
- Recent injury/illness?

### Tip 4: Use Position-Specific Norms
Don't compare a lineman's jump height to a defensive back's. Use the position comparison table to set appropriate expectations.

### Tip 5: Track Asymmetry Trends
Small asymmetries (<10%) are normal, but watch for:
- Sudden increases
- Consistent one-sided patterns
- Post-injury asymmetries that don't resolve

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: Charts not loading
**Solution:** Ensure `processed_cmj_data.json` is in the same folder as the HTML files

### Problem: No athletes showing after selecting position
**Solution:** Make sure you selected a position first, then refresh athlete dropdown

### Problem: Data seems incorrect
**Solution:** Check that you're viewing the latest test (not an old one from weeks ago)
